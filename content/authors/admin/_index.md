<p>I am <strong>Jiannan Zhang (张剑南)</strong>, a scientific researcher and currently work as an Associate Professor in the College of Life Sciences at <strong>Sichuan University</strong>. I conduct my research as a member of Professor <a href="http://life.scu.edu.cn/info/1048/1836.htm">Yajun Wang</a>'s lab.</p>

<p>My research interests are centered around <strong>Avian Physiology</strong>, <strong>Endocrinology and Metabolism</strong>, with a focus on understanding the mechanisms that regulate growth, development, and reproduction in chickens. I am particularly interested in exploring the role of hormones in modulating these processes and have conducted studies on the hormonal regulation of feed intake, nutrient utilization, and energy metabolism.</p>

<p>In addition to my work in avian physiology, I am also engage in the study of <strong>Genome Editing</strong> in chickens. I aim to develop new tools and technologies to improve the efficiency and precision of genetic modifications in avian species. My ultimate goal is to contribute to a better understanding of avian biology and to develop innovative solutions for improving poultry production and welfare.</p>
