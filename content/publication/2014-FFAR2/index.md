abstract: Free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2, also called GPR43) is reported to play a critical role in mediating the actions of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in humans and mice. However, little is known about the structure, functionality, and tissue expression of FFA2 in other mammalian species, including pigs. In the present study, the full-length cDNAs of FFA2 (pFFA2) and a novel FFA2-like gene (named pFFA2L) were cloned from pig intestines by reverse transcription PCR. Both cloned pFFA2 and pFFA2L are predicted to encode 2 receptors of remarkable structural similarity and share high amino acid sequence identities with FFA2 from other mammalian species. Interestingly, the novel FFA2L could also be identified in 9 other mammalian species, suggesting that FFA2L was likely duplicated from FFA2 in the last common ancestor of these species. With the use of a pGL4-SRE-luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that pFFA2 expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells could be activated by acetate, propionate, and butyrate equipotently, whereas pFFA2L could be activated only by acetate and propionate, indicating that both pFFA2 and pFFA2L are functional receptors for SCFAs with nonidentical pharmacologic properties. Reverse transcription PCR found that pFFA2 mRNA was widely expressed in nearly all tissues examined, including adipose tissue and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, whereas pFFA2L expression was mainly restricted to the GI tract. Taken together, our findings raise a novel concept that the actions of SCFAs are likely mediated by 2 FFA2s (FFA2 and FFA2L) in target tissues of some mammalian species, such as the GI tract of pigs.
