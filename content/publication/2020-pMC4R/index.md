abstract: In humans and mice, melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) and melanocortin receptor accessory protein 2 (MRAP2) can form a complex and control energy balance, thus regulating body weight and obesity. In pigs, a missense variant (p.Asp298Asn) of MC4R has been suggested to be associated with growth and fatness; however, the effect of Asp298Asn substitution on MC4R function is controversial, limiting its application in animal breeding. Here we examined the effect of this polymorphism on MC4R constitutive activity, cell surface expression and signaling, and its interaction with MRAP2 in pigs. We found that (i) both pig MC4RAsp and MC4RAsn can be activated by its ligands (α-MSH and ACTH) and stimulate cAMP/PKA signaling pathway, as detected by pGL3-CRE-luciferase reporter assay, indicating that, like pMC4RAsp , pMC4RAsn is coupled to the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway; (ii) compared with pMC4RAsp , pMC4RAsn loses the basal constitutive activity and shows a decreased surface expression, as detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay and Nano-HiBiT system; (iii) as in other vertebrates, both pMC4RAsp and pMC4RAsn can interact with pMRAP2, thus decreasing receptor surface expression and enhancing ligand sensitivity, although, in contrast to pMC4RAsp , the basal constitutive activity of pMC4RAsn cannot be affected by pMRAP2; and (iv) RNA-seq data analysis revealed a co-expression of MC4R and MRAP2 in pig hypothalamus. Taken together, our data provide convincing evidence that Asp298Asn substitution decreases the constitutive activity and cell surface expression of MC4R or MC4R-MRAP2 complex, which may affect energy balance and be a valuable selection marker for breeding programs in pigs.

summary: In addition, we found that pig MRAP2 can decrease surface expression, increase the ligand sensitivity and selectivity of pMC4RAsp/pMC4RAsn, and enhance the basal constitutive activity of pMC4RAsp.
