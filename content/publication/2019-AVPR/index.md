abstract: Two structurally related peptides, arginine vasotocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MT), are reported to regulate many physiological processes, such as anti-diuresis and oviposition in birds, and their actions are likely mediated by four AVT/MT receptors (AVPR1A, AVPR1B, MTR and AVPR2b), which are orthologous/paralogous to human AVPR1A, AVPR1B, OXTR and AVPR2 respectively. However, our knowledge regarding the functions of these avian AVT/MT receptors has been limited. Here, we examined the functionality and expression of these receptors in chickens and investigated the roles of AVT in the anterior pituitary. Our results showed that 1) AVPR1A, AVPR1B and AVPR2b could be preferentially activated by AVT, monitored by cell-based luciferase reporter assays and/or Western blot, indicating that they are AVT-specific receptors (AVPR1A; AVPR1B) or AVT-preferring receptor (AVPR2b) functionally coupled to intracellular calcium, MAPK/ERK and cAMP/PKA signaling pathways. In contrast, MTR could be activated by AVT and MT with similar potencies, indicating that MTR is a receptor common for both peptides; 2) Using qPCR, differential expression of the four receptors was found in chicken tissues including the oviduct and anterior pituitary. In particular, only AVPR1A is abundantly expressed in the uterus, suggesting its involvement in mediating AVT-induced oviposition. 3) In cultured chick pituitary cells, AVT could stimulate ACTH and PRL expression and secretion, an action likely mediated by AVPR1B and/or AVPR1A abundantly expressed in anterior pituitary. Collectively, our data helps to elucidate the roles of AVT/MT in birds, such as the ‘oxytocic action’ of AVT, which induces uterine muscle contraction during oviposition.

summary: In summary, we proved that AVT possesses four functional receptors (AVPR1A, AVPR1B, AVPR2b and MTR), and MT has a single receptor (MTR).
