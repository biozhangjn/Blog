abstract: The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) signaling system is involved in a variety of physiological functions, including the control of cognition, reward, learning, memory, and vasoconstriction in vertebrates. Contrary to the extensive studies in the mammalian system, little is known about the molecular characteristics of the avian serotonin signaling network. In this study, we cloned and characterized the full-length cDNA of three serotonin receptor genes (HTR1B, HTR1E and HTR1F) in chicken pituitaries. Synteny analyses indicated that HTR1B, HTR1E and HTR1F were highly conserved across vertebrates. Cell-based luciferase reporter assays showed that the three chicken HTRs were functional, capable of binding their natural ligands (5-HT) or selective agonists (CP94253, BRL54443, and LY344864) and inhibiting intracellular cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activation of these receptors could stimulate the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade. Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that HTR1B, HTR1E and HTR1F were primarily expressed in various brain regions and the pituitary. In cultured chicken pituitary cells, we found that LY344864 could significantly inhibit the secretion of PRL stimulated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) or forskolin, revealing that HTR1F might be involved in the release of prolactin in chicken. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism and facilitate a better understanding of the serotonergic modulation via HTR1B, HTR1E and HTR1F in avian species.

summary: In summary, the full-length cDNA of the three chicken 5-HT receptor genes (HTR1B, HTR1E, and HTR1F) were first reported in the present study. Sequence alignment showed that the three genes showed high sequence identity with their counterparts in other vertebrates. Moreover, synteny analysis revealed that HTR1B, HTR1E, and HTR1F are highly conserved among vertebrates and supported previous findings that chicken receptors are orthologous to the known receptor groups. Functional studies demonstrated that HTR1B, HTR1E, and HTR1F are functional and responsive to 5-HT and various selective agonists CP94253, BRL54443 and LY344864, respectively. Together with the enriched expression of the three receptors in the pituitary, the observation that LY344864 can partially inhibit PRL secretion in cultured chicken pituitary cells suggest that HTR1F is likely involved in regulating the release of the chicken pituitary PRL. Our findings represent the first key step in establishing the molecular basis for the better understanding of the serotonergic modulation network in avian species.
